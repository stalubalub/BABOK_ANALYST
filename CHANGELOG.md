# Changelog

All notable changes to BABOK Analyst project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.6] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **BABOK_Agent_LLM_Prompt.md:** Rewritten for v2.2.6 — 9-stage pipeline (Stage 0 gate), 16 MCP tools, plugin marketplace, slash commands with PL/ENG, CLI highlights, Short Rationale + Evidence, and current project storage model.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Slash commands — project language:** `/babok-new` asks for PL vs ENG when no argument is given; `/babok-new PL`, `/babok-new ENG`, `/babok-new-pl`, and `/babok-new-eng` start Stage 0 in the chosen language.
- **Docs:** Updated `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `babok-help`, and README command table.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Codex MCP handshake:** Replaced `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` paths in `.mcp.json` with `cwd: "."` and `hooks/babok-mcp-launcher.cjs` — Codex does not interpolate Claude plugin variables.
- **MCP dependencies:** Launcher runs `npm install` in `babok-mcp/` on first start when `node_modules` is missing.
- **Projects path:** Launcher and `babok-mcp` resolve workspace `projects/` via `CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` or upward directory search.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **Version bump:** All packages and plugin manifests synchronized to `2.2.3`.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Codex marketplace:** Added `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and materialized plugin bundle at `plugins/babok_analyst/` — Codex rejects empty local source path `./` and could not discover plugins from repo root alone.
- **Codex install docs:** Marketplace add must run in a normal terminal (outside Codex sandbox) to write under `~/.codex`.

### Added
- **`scripts/sync-codex-plugin.cjs`:** Keeps `plugins/babok_analyst/` in sync with the portable plugin surface at repo root.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **README.md:** Expanded plugin marketplace install guide (v2.2+), component table, troubleshooting matrix (`marketplace not found`, `agents: Invalid input`, MCP cache), release badge, version footer updated.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Claude Code plugin install:** Removed invalid `agents`/`commands`/`skills`/`mcpServers` string paths from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Claude Code validates these as arrays only; components now auto-discover from standard directories (matches official Anthropic plugins).
- **Claude slash commands:** Added `commands/babok-new.md`, `babok-status.md`, `babok-help.md` (Claude requires `.md`; `.toml` kept for Copilot/Codex).

### Changed
- **Install docs:** Marketplace slug corrected to `GSkuza/BABOK_ANALYST` with troubleshooting for `marketplace not found` error.
- **Version bump:** All packages and plugin manifests synchronized to `2.2.0`.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Per-stage LLM routing in orchestrator pipeline:** Stages 3, 4, 6, and 8 (Deep Analysis) can now use a separate, more capable model while lighter stages (1, 2, 5, 7) use the default model.
  - New `createLlmClient(provider, apiKey, modelName)` factory in `cli/src/llm.js` — stateless, reusable, no global state side effects.
  - `cli/src/orchestrator/engine.js`: `DEEP_ANALYSIS_STAGES = {3, 4, 6, 8}` constant; `runPipeline()` accepts new `deepAnalysisClient` option and routes accordingly; progress events include `mode: 'deep_analysis' | 'standard'`.
  - `cli/src/commands/run.js`: `--orchestrate` path initializes both `llmClient` and `deepAnalysisClient` with full provider selection.
  - New **`--deep-model <name>`** CLI flag on `babok run` — specifies model for deep-analysis stages (falls back to `--model` when omitted).

### Usage
```bash
# Gemini Flash for stages 1,2,5,7 + Gemini Pro for stages 3,4,6,8
babok run --orchestrate --provider gemini --model gemini-2.0-flash --deep-model gemini-1.5-pro

# OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini standard, o3 for deep analysis
babok run --orchestrate --provider openai --model gpt-4o-mini --deep-model o3
```

### Security

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **MCP Server (`babok-mcp/`):** New standalone package exposing BABOK project management as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. Claude, GPT-4o, and any MCP-compatible AI assistant can now create projects, load stage instructions, approve stages, search deliverables, and export results — without leaving the chat interface.
- **8 MCP Tools:** `babok_new_project`, `babok_list_projects`, `babok_get_stage`, `babok_approve_stage`, `babok_get_deliverable`, `babok_save_deliverable`, `babok_search`, `babok_export`.
- **9 MCP Resources:** All stage prompt files (Stages 0–8) exposed as `babok://stages/{n}` URIs — the AI reads the actual BABOK instructions before working on each stage.
- **Smoke test suite (`babok-mcp/src/test/smoke.js`):** 10 assertions covering ID generation, journal CRUD, approval flow, rejection, partial ID resolution, and deliverable I/O.
- **`BABOK_PROJECTS_DIR` and `BABOK_AGENT_DIR` env vars:** Configure where journals and stage prompts live — works standalone or nested inside the monorepo.

### Architecture
This release adds the `babok-mcp/` package as the second component alongside `cli/`. Both share the same project/journal data model (identical JSON format).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Stage 0: Project Charter:** New pre-Stage 1 gate (`BABOK_agent_stage_0.md`) that captures business trigger, sponsor sign-off, and scope boundary in 15–30 minutes. New projects now start at Stage 0.
- **`babok diff` command:** Single-ID mode shows journal stage history with deliverable file preview. Two-ID mode runs an LCS-based line diff across stage deliverables with colored `+/-` output and configurable context (`--context N`).
- **Prompt Linter (`cli/scripts/lint-stages.js`):** Validates all 9 stage files (0–8) for required sections (`## Objectives`, `## Process`), unfilled placeholders, token estimate, and file existence. Exits non-zero on errors.
- **GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/lint-prompts.yml`):** Automatically runs the stage linter on every push or PR that touches `BABOK_AGENT/stages/`.

### Changed
- **Stage validation range:** `babok approve` and `babok reject` now accept stage `0` through `8` (previously `1–8`).
- **Completion message:** "All 8 stages complete!" updated to "All stages complete!" to accommodate variable stage counts.
- **Journal initialization:** New projects include Stage 0 in their `stages` array with `current_stage: 0`.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Automated Analysis Pipeline:** New `babok run` command with context-driven execution and optional auto-run mode.
