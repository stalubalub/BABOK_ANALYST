## Deliverable Template

**Single source of truth:** `templates/stages/STAGE_01_Project_Initialization.md`

Load before writing the deliverable:
- MCP: `babok_get_stage_template` with `stage_n: 1`
- CLI/file: read `templates/stages/STAGE_01_Project_Initialization.md`

**Critical:** Keep all H2 headings from the template unchanged so `babok score` completeness checks pass.
