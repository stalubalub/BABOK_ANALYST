# BABOK Analyst v2.1.0 - Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 24, 2026
**Status:** Minor Release
**License:** MIT

---

## Plugin Marketplace Install (NEW)

One-command install across Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot CLI:

```
/plugin marketplace add GSkuza/BABOK_ANALYST
/plugin install babok_analyst@babok_analyst
```

```
codex plugin marketplace add GSkuza/BABOK_ANALYST
```

```
copilot plugin marketplace add GSkuza/BABOK_ANALYST
copilot plugin install babok_analyst@babok_analyst
```

Bundled: marketplace manifests, portable `.mcp.json` (16 MCP tools), lifecycle hooks, skills, agents, slash commands, uninstall path. See `docs/agent-portability.md`.

---

## What's New in v2.1.0

### 1. Architecture Documentation (`docs/`)

New dedicated `docs/` directory with four reference documents:

- **`L2_L3_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — design blueprint for the L2 (MCP) and L3 (multi-agent) layers, including sequence diagrams and deployment topologies.
- **`MCP_TOOLS_SPECIFICATION.md`** — complete specification for all 16 MCP tools: input schemas, output formats, error codes, and usage examples.
- **`MIGRATION_GUIDE_L1_to_L2.md`** — step-by-step guide for teams moving from the standalone CLI (L1) to the MCP server (L2), including config diff and rollback instructions.
- **`workflows.md`** — annotated workflow diagrams covering the full project lifecycle from initialization to final export.

### 2. Document Templates (`templates/`)

Production-ready Markdown templates for every core BABOK deliverable:

- **`BRD_Template.md`** — Business Requirements Document with pre-filled structure for scope, stakeholders, requirements, and approval sign-off.
- **`Risk_Register_Template.md`** — Risk Register with probability/impact matrix, mitigation plans, and owner assignments.
- **`Stakeholder_Analysis_Template.md`** — Stakeholder Analysis including RACI matrix, communication plan, and influence/interest grid.
- **`User_Story_Template.md`** — User Story with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, priority fields, and estimation notes.
- **`project_context.example.json`** — Updated reference context file for `babok run` (aligned with `context_schema_v2.json`).

### 3. BABOK Agent Stage Files (`BABOK_AGENT/stages/`)

All 9 stage instruction files (Stage 0 – Stage 8) are now available as individual Markdown documents. Each file can be used standalone: paste directly into any LLM chat interface or reference via MCP resource URI `babok://stages/{n}`.

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration (`BABOK_AGENT/agents/`)

New orchestration layer enabling automated multi-agent pipelines:

- **`orchestrator_config.json`** — defines the agent pipeline: which model runs which stage, handoff rules, and retry logic.
- **Per-stage configs** (`stage1_config.json` … `stage8_config.json`) — isolated model and prompt configuration for each stage.
- **Quality Audit Agent** (`quality_audit_agent.md` + `quality_scoring_rubric.json`) — automated post-stage quality review that scores deliverables and flags gaps before human approval.
- **`context_schema_v2.json`** — extended context schema with agent metadata, routing fields, and structured output contracts.

### 5. Consolidated System Prompt (`BABOK_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`)

New root-level `BABOK_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` bundles all agent instructions into a single file for one-paste deployment to Claude.ai Projects, ChatGPT Custom Instructions, or any LLM API.

### 6. Automated Manual Generator (`generate_manual.py`)

Python script that compiles DOCX and PDF user manuals from the Markdown source files. Supports Polish and English outputs, custom cover pages, and table-of-contents generation.

### 7. GitHub Copilot Integration

- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — Full 1,600-line Copilot Chat instructions file. VS Code users can now run the complete BABOK workflow natively inside the editor without switching to a separate chat interface.
- **`.github/prompts/`** — Nine stage-specific prompt files and a full-run prompt for Copilot Chat's "Ask" mode.

### 8. CI: Prompt Linter

- **`.github/workflows/lint-prompts.yml`** — GitHub Actions workflow that runs `cli/scripts/lint-stages.js` on every push or PR that touches `BABOK_AGENT/stages/`, catching missing sections and unfilled placeholders before merge.

### Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes from v2.0.2.
- Existing projects and journals remain fully compatible.
- New `templates/` and `docs/` directories are additive only.
- Multi-agent orchestration is opt-in; existing CLI and MCP workflows are unchanged.

# BABOK Analyst v2.0.2 - Release Notes

**Release Date:** March 16, 2026
**Status:** Patch Release
**License:** MIT

---

## What's New in v2.0.2

### 1. Fixed `setup.bat` (Root Installer)

The root-level `setup.bat` was completely rewritten to fix multiple critical bugs:

- **Removed UTF-8 box-drawing characters** (`─`, `━`) that caused cmd.exe to misparse lines when combined with `chcp 65001`
- **Added `setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion`** so `!errorlevel!` works correctly inside `if` blocks (previously `%errorlevel%` was always 0 inside parentheses)
- **Removed `chcp 65001`** — caused cmd.exe byte-counting mismatch leading to skipped/garbled output lines
- **Replaced `cmd /k`** at the end with `pause >nul` — no more orphaned nested shell after installation
- **Fixed PATH refresh** — reads fresh Machine+User registry PATH at startup; prevents "node not found" on fresh installs launched from Explorer
- **Added Node.js fallback search** — checks standard install locations (`%ProgramFiles%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`) if `node` isn't on PATH
- **Fixed `setx PATH` safety** — no longer passes the full expanded `%PATH%` (which would truncate at 1024 chars); now reads and extends only the User-scoped registry PATH

### 2. New `babok-mcp/setup.bat` (MCP Server Installer)

Added a dedicated one-click Windows installer for the `babok-mcp` server:

- Detects Node.js (with fallback location search)
- Runs `npm install` for MCP dependencies
- Validates server entry point with `node --check` (no hang — does not start the server)
- Displays the ready-to-paste JSON config block for `claude_desktop_config.json`, with dynamically resolved absolute paths (forward slashes, no `..` segments)
- Offers to open `claude_desktop_config.json` in Notepad if Claude Desktop is installed
- Works in any install location (not hardcoded to `D:`)

### 3. Updated MCP User Manuals

- **`babok-mcp-podrecznik uzytkownika.md`** (PL) — updated to v2.0.2: added `setup.bat` as install option, described `babok_rename_project` and `babok_delete_project` tools (were missing), updated tool count from 8 to 10, corrected FAQ entries for rename/delete
- **`babok-mcp-user-manual.md`** (EN) — **new file**: full English translation of the MCP user manual, covering all 10 tools, 4 client configurations, troubleshooting, and FAQ

### Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes from v2.0.1.
- Existing projects remain fully compatible.
- `setup.bat` can be re-run safely on existing installations.
