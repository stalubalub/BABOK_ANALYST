# BABOK Stage 1: Project Initialization & Stakeholder Mapping

## Stage Instructions

Read the full stage instructions from the file:
`BABOK_AGENT/stages/BABOK_agent_stage_1.md`

## Templates to Use

Primary deliverable skeleton:

- `templates/stages/STAGE_01_Project_Initialization.md`

MCP: `babok_get_stage_template(stage_n: 1, include_modules: true)`

## Context Template

Read the project context structure from:
`templates/project_context.example.json`

## Your Task

1. Ask the user for project information following the questions in the stage instructions.
2. Generate a complete Stage 1 deliverable document covering:
   - Project scope and boundaries
   - Stakeholder identification and mapping
   - Success criteria (quantitative + qualitative)
   - Communication plan
   - Assumptions, dependencies, constraints

3. Save the output by running:
   ```
   babok run --context my_project_context.json --stages 1 --output BABOK_Analysis
   ```
   Or write the content directly to `BABOK_Analysis/<project_id>/STAGE_01_Project_Initialization.md`

## Output Format

The document should be a professional, structured Markdown file following BABOK v3 standards.
